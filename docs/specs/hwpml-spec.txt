(Hwp Document File Format 3.x)

�글 문서 파일 형식 3.x

1. 개요
글의 문서 파일은 사용자가 따로 지정하지 않는 한 HWP를 기본 확장자로 가진다. 문서 파일에
저장되는 내용은, 실제 사용자가 입력한 문서의 내용과 문자 장식 정보뿐만 아니라 문서를 편집할
당시의 글꼴에 대한 정보, 조판에 영향을 주는 설정 사항(용지 종류, 여백 정보 등)도 포함된다.
글 문서 파일 형식 3.x에는 이전 버전과는 달리, 단과 페이지의 구분에 대한 정보가 저장된다. 그러나
이 정보는 글 97에서 저장된 문서가 아닌 경우 존재하지 않을 수 있으므로 부가적인 ‘힌트’의 의미로
사용되어야 하며, 이에 전적으로 의존해서는 안 된다. 완전하고 안전한 페이지 구분은 문서 파일을
읽은 쪽에서 페이지 정리(pagination)를 통해 재구성해야 한다.
글의 문서 파일은 전체 파일 내용을 순차적으로 한번 읽는 것만으로 해석이 가능하다. 따라서 파일에
대한 비순차적인 접근(random access)은 굳이 필요하지 않다.
글은 문서 파일의 압축 기능을 지원한다. 압축된 문서 파일도 기본적인 정보를 저장하는 앞부분은
압축되지 않으며, 실제 압축되는 부분은 사용자가 입력한 데이터 부분이다.
글은 문서 파일의 압축에 FSF(Free Software Foundation)의 gzip을 사용했다. gzip은 범용 압축
프로그램으로서, FSF의 다른 소프트웨어와 마찬가지로, FSF에서 정한 GNU General Public License
를 지키면 실행 프로그램과 소스 리스트를 사용 및 변형할 수 있다. 자세한 것은 gzip에 포함되어
있는 문서 파일을 참조하기 바란다.
글에서는 압축되는 부분 전체가 하나의 스트림(stream)으로 압축되므로, 압축된 파일을 읽는 가장
손쉬운 방법은 일단 임시 파일로 압축을 푼 다음 그 파일을 대상으로 압축되지 않은 파일과 동일한
처리 과정을 거치면 된다.
글 문서 파일 형식 3.x은 글 윈도우즈/도스 3.0 버전의 구조를 기본으로 확장되었다. 글 3.0
이후에 변경된 내용은 미리 준비된 예약 영역을 이용했기 때문에, 글 97에서 저장된 문서 파일은
추가된 정보의 일부 손실을 제외하면 글 3.0 이후 버전에서 별도의 변환 과정 없이 읽을 수 있다.

2. 자료형 설명
앞으로 계속되는 설명에서 글의 문서 파일에 저장되는 정보는 아래 표에 설명하는 자료형을 이용해
표현한다.
자료형에서 한 바이트는 8비트로 표현되며, 두 바이트 이상의 길이를 가지는 자료형은 최하위 바이트가
가장 먼저 저장되고, 최상위 바이트가 가장 나중에 저장되는 리틀 인디언(little indian) 형태이다.
파일에 저장되는 자료가 배열(array)일 때는 ‘자료형 array[개수]’와 같이 표현한다. 예를 들어 10개의
원소를 갖는 word 배열이면 ‘word array[10]’과 같이 표현한다.

표 1 설명에 사용된 자료형

hchar는 글의 내부 코드로 표현된 문자 한 글자를 표현하는 자료형이다. 글의 내부 코드는 한글,
영문, 한자를 비롯해 모든 문자가 2바이트의 일정한 길이를 가진다. 글의 내부 코드에 대한 자세한
사항은 글 설명서를 참조하기 바란다.
echar와 kchar는 표준 C의 자료형인 char와 같은 의미로 생각하면 되는데, 차이점은 echar는 영문
아스키 코드(0-127)만을 표현하고, kchar는 상용조합형 한글도 표현할 수 있다는 점이다. 예를 들어
문서 파일에 저장되는 글꼴 이름을 설명하는 곳에서 ‘kchar array[40]’로 나타나 있는데, 이것은 상용조
합형 한글이 포함될 수 있는 최대 길이 40바이트의 문자열이라는 뜻이다.
hunit과 shunit는 문자의 크기, 그림의 크기, 용지 여백 등, 문서를 구성하는 요소들의 크기를 표현하기
위한 자료형이다. 문서 출력 장치의 해상도는 가변적이기 때문에, 크기 정보를 점(도트)의 수로 표현할
수는 없고 일정한 단위를 기준으로 해야 하는데, 글에서는 1/1800인치를 기본 단위로 사용한다.
예를 들어 가로 2인치 세로 1인치짜리 그림의 크기를 hunit 형으로 표현하면 각각 3600, 1800이 된다.

표 2 글 문서 파일의 전체 구조

압축된 문서 파일의 경우 ‘글꼴 이름’부터 ‘추가 정보 블록’까지의 자료가 하나의 압축된 스트림(stream)
으로 저장되므로, 문서 파일을 읽는 쪽에서는 ‘문서 정보’ 항목의 ‘압축’ 플래그를 살펴보고 압축된
파일이면 압축을 풀어서 처리해야 한다. 이후의 설명에서는 압축이 풀린 상태의 파일을 기준으로
한다.

3.1. 파일 인식 정보
글의 문서 파일이라는 것을 나타내기 위해 파일의 가장 첫 부분 30바이트는 인식 정보가 저장된다.
이 정보는 다음과 같은 내용을 가진다.

정보 블록은 아예 존재하지 않거나, 여러 개의 정보 블록이 연속해 존재할 수 있다. 정보 블록 전체의
길이는 문서 정보의 ‘정보 블록 길이’ 항목에 바이트 단위로 저장된다.
정보 블록은 파일의 앞 부분 고정된 위치에 저장되며, 압축에서 제외되는 영역이기 때문에 파일 전체를
읽지 않고도 쉽게 읽어낼 필요가 있는 정보를 저장하는 목적으로 사용된다.
글에서 정보 블록에 저장하는 내용은 [책갈피]와 [상호참조]가 있다. 더 자세한 내용은 ‘정보 블록
자료 구조’를 참조하기 바란다.

3.5. 글꼴 이름
글 문서 파일에는 문서를 편집할 당시의 시스템에 등록되어 있는 글꼴의 이름들이 함께 저장된다.
문서 중간의 글자 모양에서 특정한 글꼴을 참조할 때는 글꼴 이름의 인덱스(index)를 이용한다.
글꼴 이름은 처음 word 형으로 글꼴 이름의 개수가 나오며, 그 개수만큼 kchar 형으로 40바이트
길이의 문자열이 반복된다. 이러한 형태가 각 언어별로 7번 반복되면 글꼴 이름 정보가 끝난다.

3.7. 문단 리스트
스타일 정보가 끝나면 사용자가 입력한 문단의 내용이 저장된다. 문단들은 사용자가 입력한 순서대로
저장된다. 문단 리스트는 이처럼 순서대로 저장된 일련의 문단들을 뜻한다.
글에서 모든 문단의 끝은 hchar로 표현된 특수 문자 13번(CR)으로 끝난다. 따라서 문단의 길이는
적어도 1 이상이 되는데, 문단의 길이가 0인 문단은 빈(null) 문단으로서, 문단 리스트의 끝을 나타내기
위해 사용된다.
표 등이 없는 단순한 문서 파일의 경우, 문단 리스트는 하나만 존재하지만, 표 등을 사용했을 때는
표의 각 셀이 하나씩의 문단 리스트를 가지게 되므로, 이러한 문서 파일에서는 중첩된 여러 개의 문단
리스트가 저장된다. 다음 예제를 참조하기 바란다.

표 11 문단 정보

문단 정보의 ‘앞 문단 모양’ 항목이 0이 아닐 때는 문단 모양 정보가 따로 저장되지 않고 앞 문단의
모양을 따라간다. 일반적으로 한번 지정된 문단 모양은 좀처럼 바뀌지 않는다는 점을 감안해, 중복된
정보의 저장을 줄여 파일 크기를 줄이기 위한 방법이다. 문단 리스트의 첫 번째 문단은 앞 문단이
존재하지 않기 때문에, ‘앞 문단 모양’ 항목이 늘 0이다.
비슷한 방식으로, 각 글자에 대한 모양도 문단 전체의 글자가 모두 동일한 모양일 때는 ‘대표 글자
모양’ 항목에 글자 모양이 한 번만 저장되며, 각 글자에 대한 별도의 글자 모양 정보는 저장되지 않는다.
만약 ‘글자 모양 포함’ 항목이 0이 아닐 때는 ‘대표 글자 모양’ 항목이 문서 파일에 저장은 되지만
실제 사용되지는 않는다.
‘문단 모양’ 항목은 ‘앞 문단 모양’ 항목이 0일 때만 저장되며, 이외의 경우에는 생략되므로, 글 문서
파일을 읽는 쪽에서는 문단 정보를 읽을 때 반드시 ‘앞 문단 모양’ 항목을 확인해야 한다. ‘문단 모양’
항목의 자료 구조는 ‘문단 모양 자료 구조’를 참조하기 바란다.
‘스타일’은 그 문단이 어떤 스타일을 가리키고 있는지 나타낸다. 이 값은 문서 파일의 앞부분에 저장된
스타일 정보에 대한 인덱스이다.

4.3. 글자 모양 정보
문단 내용의 글자 중에서 하나라도 다른 모양을 가진 것이 있으면, 모든 글자에 대한 글자 모양 정보가
저장된다. 그러나 이 경우에도 앞 글자와 동일한 모양을 가진 글자에 대해서는 앞 글자와 동일하다는
뜻의 1 바이트짜리 플래그 하나만 저장된다.
따라서 실제 문서 파일에 저장되는 글자 모양 정보는 다음과 같은 구조를 가진다.
§

{ byte flag, {글자 모양} }×글자 수

flag이 1이면 앞 글자 모양을 따라가며, 글자 모양은 저장되지 않는다. flag이 1 이외이면 뒤따라
글자 모양이 저장된다. 글자 모양의 자료 구조는 아래의 ‘글자 모양 자료 구조’를 참조하기 바란다.

4.4. 글자들
글자 모양 정보에 이어서 실제 문단의 내용인 글자들이 저장된다. 각 글자는 hchar로 표현되며, 문단
정보의 ‘글자 수’ 항목이 나타내는 개수만큼의 hchar 문자가 저장된다. 문단의 마지막 문자는 늘
hchar로 표현된 특수 문자 13번(CR)이다.

이용한다.
누름틀의 바이너리 데이터 중 5,6번째 바이트 값은 필드 이름을 수정하거나 하면 새로운 값으로 대체되
므로 연속된 순서값은 아니다. 그러나 문서를 마치고 새로 여는 경우에는 문서내 누름틀의 필드 번호를
1부터 끝번호까지 연속된 값으로 리셋된다.
누름틀 필드 번호와 필드 이름 길이는 각각 word이므로 문서내 삽입 가능한 누름틀 필드의 갯수 및
필드 이름의 길이는 최대 2의 16승이다.

표 31 글의 특수 문자

문서 파일에서 문단 내용을 읽다가 특수 문자를 발견하면, 문서를 읽는 쪽에서는 그 종류에 따라 읽어
들이거나 건너 뛰어 다음 데이터의 시작 위치까지 파일 포인터를 옮기기 위한 적절한 처리를 수행해야
한다. 특수 문자 가운데는 또 다른 문단 리스트를 포함하는 경우도 있기 때문에, 특수 문자를 일반
문자처럼 처리하면 문서 파일을 정상적으로 읽을 수 없다.
실제 문단 내의 모든 문자를 살펴보지 않아도, 그 문단에 특수 문자가 포함되어 있는지 없는지는 문단
정보만 읽어보고도 알 수 있다. 문단 정보의 ‘특수 문자 플래그’이 0이면 그 문단에는 특수 문자가
없는 것을 뜻하며, 이외의 경우에는 해당하는 비트가 나타내는 특수 문자가 존재함을 뜻한다.
표에서 ‘문단 리스트’ 항목에 ‘√’ 표시가 된 것은 문단 리스트를 포함하는 특수 문자를 뜻한다.
문서를 읽다가 현재 사용되지 않는 예약된 특수 문자 코드를 만났을 때는, 이후의 상위 버전과의 호환성
을 위해 적절한 크기를 건너뛰어야 한다. 건너뛸 정보의 크기는 다음과 같은 규약에 따라 알 수 있다.

10.1. 필드 코드 (5)
필드 코드는 계산식과 문서마당 정보 등을 나타내기 위해 글 96에 추가된 특수 문자이며, 범용의
특수 문자이므로, 글 96에서 사용되는 것 이외에도 앞으로 다양한 용도로 쓰일 수 있다.
필드 코드는 임의 길이의 세 개의 hchar 형 문자열과, 한 개의 바이너리 데이터를 가지고 있으며,
필드 코드의 종류에 따라 이 정보들이 고유한 의미로 해석된다.
필드 코드는 글 96 이전에 예약된 특수 문자를 정의하여 사용하고 있으므로 기본적인 형식은 예약된

그리기 개체는 여러 개의 개체를 하나의 틀로 묶을 수 있기 때문에, 하나의 그림 코드에 하나 이상의
개체가 존재할 수 있다. 파일상에는 다음과 같은 구조로 저장된다.
§

그림 정보 (348 바이트) → 틀 헤더 (28 바이트) → (optional 하이퍼텍스트 정보(4 + 617 byte))
→ { 개체 정보 1, 개체 정보 2, ... 개체 정보 n }

‘틀 헤더’는 개체를 포함하고 있는 틀의 관리에 필요한 정보를 저장하는 영역으로 자세한 내용은 아래와

11.2. 저장되는 개체의 순서
그리기 개체는 묶인 순서에 따라 계층 구조를 가진다. 예를 들어 부채꼴과 원을 묶고, 이것을 다시
사각형과 묶었을 때 다음과 같은 계층 구조를 가진다.
§

{사각형 + { 부채꼴 + 원 }}
그림 코드

컨테이너

컨테이너

‘컨테이너’는 계층 구조를 나타내기 위해 내부적으로 사용되는, 화면에는 표시되지 않는 개체로서,
묶기를 할 때마다 묶인 개체들의 ‘parent’로 하나씩 생성된다.
파일상에서의 그리기 개체는 계층 구조 트리에 대한 ‘preorder traversal’ 순서로 저장된다. 따라서
위와 같은 경우라면 다음과 같은 순서로 저장된다.
§

컨테이너 → 사각형 → 컨테이너 → 부채꼴 → 원

11.3. 개체 정보
틀 헤더에 이어서는 개체의 개수만큼 각각의 개체 정보가 저장된다. 개체 정보는 모든 개체에 공통적으
로 적용되는 속성이 저장되는 공통 헤더와, 개체에 따라 서로 다른 정보가 저장되는 세부 정보로 나뉘고,
세부 정보는 다시 두 부분으로 나뉘어 전체적으로 다음과 같은 구조를 가진다.
§

공통 헤더 (n 바이트) → {optional 글상자 정보(n byte)} → 세부 정보 1의 길이 (4 바이트) →
세부 정보 1의 내용 (n 바이트) → 세부 정보 2의 길이 (4 바이트) → 세부 정보 2의 내용 (n 바이트)

개체의 종류에 따라서 세부 정보는 존재하지 않는 경우도 있다. 세부 정보가 존재하지 않을 때는 세부
정보 1의 길이와 세부 정보 2의 길이가 0이 되므로 8개의 연속된 0으로 표현된다.
그리기 글상자일 경우엔 공통 헤더 뒤에 글상자 정보가 저장된다(글상자 정보는 11.3.6 참조).

11.3.1. 공통 헤더
공통 헤더에는 모든 그리기 속성에 공통적으로 적용되는 정보가 저장된다. 공통 헤더의 길이는 그리기
개체에 적용된 속성에 따라 달라질 수 있는데, 파일상에 다음과 같은 구조로 저장된다.
§

기본 정보 (48 바이트) → 기본 속성 (44 바이트) → 회전 속성 (32 바이트, 생략 가능) → 그라데이션
속성 (28 바이트, 생략 가능) → 비트맵 패턴 속성 (278 바이트, 생략 가능)

39

�글 문서 파일 형식 3.x

회전, 그라데이션, 비트맵 패턴 속성은 생략 가능하며, 어떤 속성 정보가 존재하는지 생략되었는지는
기본 속성의 기타 옵션으로 알 수 있다. 참고로, 회전 속성은 자료 구조에는 생략 가능하게 되어 있지만,
글 96에서는 무조건 저장하므로 늘 존재한다.

추가 정보 블록의 실제 내용은 다음과 같은 구조를 가진다.

§

인식 정보: 0xF8995567 (글 3.0, 3.0a) / 0xF8995568 (글 3.0b 이상)

글 3.0에서 저장된 스토리지 파일은 ILockBytes 인터페이스를 구현하여 바이너리 스트림을 바로
파일로 저장한 형식이며, 이런 방식으로 저장할 때 시스템 환경에 따라 문제가 발생하는 경우가 있어서
글 3.0b 이상에서는 표준 StgCreateDocfile() API를 사용한 일반 스토리지 파일을 그대로 저장하는
방식으로 바뀌었다. 따라서 글 3.0b 미만의 버전에서 저장된 OLE 정보를 읽기 위해서는 인식 정보를
읽어 그에 따른 적절한 방식을 선택해야 한다.

12.2. 스토리지 파일의 구조
루트 스토리지 아래, 특수 문자의 그림 코드에 지정된 이름과 같은 서브 스토리지가 개체의 개수만큼
존재하며, 여기에 개체의 내용이 저장된다. 개체의 저장에는 표준 OleSave() API를 사용했기 때문에
OleLoad() API로 읽을 수 있다.
글에서 각 개체 별로 자체적으로 관리하는 정보는 루트 스토리지 아래, 특수 문자의 그림 코드에
지정된 이름과 같고 확장자만 ‘.inf’로 바뀐 스트림(stream)에 저장된다. 여기에 저장되는 정보의 구조

linked가 0일 때는 표에 연결되지 않은 독립적인 차트를 뜻하며, 이 경우에는 나머지 모든 값이 의미

tblid는 문서 중의 모든 표에 각각 부여된 유일한 ID이며, 이 ID를 통해 특정한 차트가 어떤 표와 연결되
어 있는지 나타낸다.
entire가 1일 때는 이 차트가 표 전체의 데이터와 연결되었음을 뜻한다. 이 경우에는 범위를 나타내는
값이 의미가 없다. entire가 0일 때는 표의 일부분만 차트와 연결되었음을 뜻하며, 범위를 나타내는
값들이 실제 사용자가 차트를 만들 때 셀 블록으로 지정한 범위를 나타낸다.
chsize는 실제 각 셀의 내용이 순차적으로 ASCIIZ 형식으로 연속되어 배열된 데이터의 총 바이트
수를 나타낸다. 실제 데이터 내용은 ‘HWPChart.Info’가 저장된 동일한 storage에 ‘HWPChart.Data’
라는 이름의 stream으로 저장된다.
글은 사용자가 차트와 연결된 표의 내용을 바꿨을 때, 이러한 정보들을 토대로 차트를 업데이트할지
여부를 결정한다.
